# CodeBreaker - Console Game in C

A simple code-guessing game written in C, where players try to break a randomly generated code based on their chosen difficulty level.

## 🎮 How It Works:
- The player selects a difficulty: 3, 4, or 5-digit code
- The program generates a random secret code
- After each guess, feedback is given:
  - `Bool` – correct digit in the correct position
  - `Near` – correct digit in the wrong position
- The game continues until the player guesses the full code
- At the end, the program displays the number of attempts used

## 🛠️ Technologies:
- Language: C
- Console-based interaction
- Random number generation and input validation
- Loop control and logical comparison

## 🎯 Purpose:
Built to practice control structures, logic, and user input in C programming. Demonstrates basic game mechanics and interactive design in a console environment.
